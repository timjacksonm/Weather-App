# Weather-App

## Goals:
- [✔️] Write functions that use the API to fetch weather for an area.
- [✔️] Create the functions that will proccess the JSON data you're getting from the API and return an object with the data you require for you app. (temp, wind, description, extended forcast etc)
- [✔️] Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and fetch the weather info.
- [✔️] Display the info on your webpage!
- [✔️] Add any styling you like!

**Optional Extra Credit**
- [] Add a 'loading' component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
- [] Review the different syntax used for SASS and implement SASS into the project instead of normal CSS.
